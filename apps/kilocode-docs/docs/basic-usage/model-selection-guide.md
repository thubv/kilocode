## Comprehensive Evaluation Framework

### Latency Performance

Response times significantly impact development flow and productivity:

- **Ultra-Fast (< 2s)**: Grok Code Fast 1, Qwen3 Coder
- **Fast (2-4s)**: DeepSeek V3, GPT-5
- **Moderate (4-8s)**: Claude Sonnet 4, DeepSeek R1
- **Slower (8-15s)**: Gemini 2.5 Pro, Z AI GLM 4.5

**Impact on Development**: Ultra-fast models enable real-time coding assistance and immediate feedback loops. Models with 8+ second latency can disrupt flow state but may be acceptable for complex architectural decisions.

### Throughput Analysis

Token generation rates affect large codebase processing:

- **High Throughput (150+ tokens/s)**: GPT-5, Grok Code Fast 1
- **Medium Throughput (100-150 tokens/s)**: Claude Sonnet 4, Qwen3 Coder
- **Standard Throughput (50-100 tokens/s)**: DeepSeek models, Gemini 2.5 Pro
- **Variable Throughput**: Open source models depend on infrastructure

**Scaling Factors**: High throughput models excel when generating extensive documentation, refactoring large files, or batch processing multiple components.

### Reliability & Availability

Enterprise considerations for production environments:

- **Enterprise Grade (99.9%+ uptime)**: Claude Sonnet 4, GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro
- **Production Ready (99%+ uptime)**: Qwen3 Coder, Grok Code Fast 1
- **Developing Reliability**: DeepSeek models, Z AI GLM 4.5
- **Self-Hosted**: Qwen3 32B (reliability depends on your infrastructure)

**Success Rates**: Enterprise models maintain consistent output quality and handle edge cases more gracefully, while budget options may require additional validation steps.

### Context Window Strategy

Optimizing for different project scales:

| Size             | Word Count      | Typical Use Case                      | Recommended Models                     | Strategy                                        |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **32K tokens**   | ~24,000 words   | Individual components, scripts        | DeepSeek V3, Qwen3 Coder               | Focus on single-file optimization               |
| **128K tokens**  | ~96,000 words   | Standard applications, most projects  | All budget models, Grok Code Fast 1    | Multi-file context, moderate complexity         |
| **256K tokens**  | ~192,000 words  | Large applications, multiple services | Qwen3 Coder, Grok Code Fast 1          | Full feature context, service integration       |
| **400K+ tokens** | ~300,000+ words | Enterprise systems, full stack apps   | GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro | Architectural overview, system-wide refactoring |

**Performance Degradation**: Model effectiveness typically drops significantly beyond 400-500K tokens, regardless of advertised limits. Plan context usage accordingly.
