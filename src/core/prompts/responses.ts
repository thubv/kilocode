const toolUseInstructionsReminder = `# Reminder: Instructions for Tool Use

Tool uses are formatted using XML-style tags. The tool name itself becomes the XML tag name. Each parameter is enclosed within its own set of tags. Here's the structure:

<actual_tool_name>
<parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
<parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
...
</actual_tool_name>

For example, to use the attempt_completion tool:

<attempt_completion>
<result>
I have completed the task...
</result>
</attempt_completion>

Always use the actual tool name as the XML tag name for proper parsing and execution.`
