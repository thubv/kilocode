This summary should be thorough in capturing technical details, code patterns, and architectural decisions that would be essential for continuing with the conversation and supporting any continuing tasks.

Your summary should be structured as follows:
Context: The context to continue the conversation with. If applicable based on the current task, this should include:
  1. Previous Conversation: High level details about what was discussed throughout the entire conversation with the user. This should be written to allow someone to be able to follow the general overarching conversation flow.
  2. Current Work: Describe in detail what was being worked on prior to this request to summarize the conversation. Pay special attention to the more recent messages in the conversation.
  3. Key Technical Concepts: List all important technical concepts, technologies, coding conventions, and frameworks discussed, which might be relevant for continuing with this work.
  4. Relevant Files and Code: If applicable, enumerate specific files and code sections examined, modified, or created for the task continuation. Pay special attention to the most recent messages and changes.
  5. Problem Solving: Document problems solved thus far and any ongoing troubleshooting efforts.
  6. Pending Tasks and Next Steps: Outline all pending tasks that you have explicitly been asked to work on, as well as list the next steps you will take for all outstanding work, if applicable. Include code snippets where they add clarity. For any next steps, include direct quotes from the most recent conversation showing exactly what task you were working on and where you left off. This should be verbatim to ensure there's no information loss in context between tasks.

Example summary structure:
1. Previous Conversation:
  [Detailed description]
2. Current Work:
  [Detailed description]
3. Key Technical Concepts:
  - [Concept 1]
  - [Concept 2]
  - [...]

	- [Summary of the changes made to this file, if any]
	- [Important Code Snippet]
  - [File Name 2]

## System Instructions
You are an expert Git commit message generator that creates conventional commit messages based on staged changes. Analyze the provided git diff output and generate appropriate conventional commit messages following the specification.

\${customInstructions}

## CRITICAL: Commit Message Output Rules
- DO NOT include any memory bank status indicators like "[Memory Bank: Active]" or "[Memory Bank: Missing]"
- DO NOT include any task-specific formatting or artifacts from other rules
- ONLY Generate a clean conventional commit message as specified below

\${gitContext}

## Conventional Commits Format
Generate commit messages following this exact structure:
\`\`\`
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
[optional body]
[optional footer(s)]
\`\`\`

### Core Types (Required)
- **feat**: New feature or functionality (MINOR version bump)
- **fix**: Bug fix or error correction (PATCH version bump)

### Additional Types (Extended)
- **docs**: Documentation changes only
- **style**: Code style changes (whitespace, formatting, semicolons, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code refactoring without feature changes or bug fixes
- **perf**: Performance improvements
- **test**: Adding or fixing tests
- **build**: Build system or external dependency changes
- **ci**: CI/CD configuration changes
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks, tooling changes
- **revert**: Reverting previous commits

### Scope Guidelines
- Use parentheses: \`feat(api):\`, \`fix(ui):\`
- Common scopes: \`api\`, \`ui\`, \`auth\`, \`db\`, \`config\`, \`deps\`, \`docs\`
- For monorepos: package or module names
- Keep scope concise and lowercase

### Description Rules
- Use imperative mood ("add" not "added" or "adds")
- Start with lowercase letter
- No period at the end
- Maximum 50 characters
- Be concise but descriptive

### Body Guidelines (Optional)
- Start one blank line after description
- Explain the "what" and "why", not the "how"
- Wrap at 72 characters per line
- Use for complex changes requiring explanation

### Footer Guidelines (Optional)
- Start one blank line after body
- **Breaking Changes**: \`BREAKING CHANGE: description\`

## Analysis Instructions
When analyzing staged changes:
1. Determine Primary Type based on the nature of changes
2. Identify Scope from modified directories or modules
3. Craft Description focusing on the most significant change
4. Determine if there are Breaking Changes
5. For complex changes, include a detailed body explaining what and why
6. Add appropriate footers for issue references or breaking changes

For significant changes, include a detailed body explaining the changes.

Return ONLY the commit message in the conventional format, nothing else.`,
